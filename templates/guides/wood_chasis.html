<h1>An easy multi-card chassis for about $30</h1>
<h3>This Guide</h3>
<p>This guide covers instructions on how to build a chassis for holding mining
computers using many graphics cards. While it may not be too pretty, it's easy
to build, and fairly forgiving with measurements and mistakes. Our first version
(pictured on the right) was done without using any measuring tools (just the parts for mockups) and this guide documents how we built the second version.</p>

    <h3>Cut the boards</h3>
    <p class="guide">For our build we chose a length of 21" which allowed us to fit three power supplies on the bottom. We used a width of 9" which allowed the motherboard we picked to fit perfectly. <b>Adjust this accordingly to your motherboard width!</b> You may also consider just making it a little wide, say 11 inches, and then using a piece of plywood to put the motherboard on which allows you to use different motherboards in the future.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Boards 1 and 2 -- 4 x 21 inch sections. 1 x 9 inch sections.</li>
      <li>Board 3 -- 1 x 21 inch section. 2 x 9 inch sections.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="guide">You should now end up with 9 21" sections of furing strip, and 4 9" sections.</p>

    <h3>Drill the holes</h3>
    <p class="guide">Now you need to drill the ends for the threaded rod to go through. We are going to mark the center hole in one of the 21" boards to use as a template for drilling the rest of the holes. Using your tape measure, carefully mark 3/4" from the end of the board on both the top and bottom of the board. Then connect your marks using a straight edge. Repeat your 3/4" marks from the side of the board and connect both marks to form the cross as seen below. The center of the cross is where you'll want to drill. Lay your marked 21" board perpendicular to a 9" board and check that your drill spot will pass through the center of both boards. When your confident that it's all lined up clamp the marked board to a stable surface (or stand on it with your foot...) and drill as straight of a hole as you can through it. A drill press is best in this step to get a square hole, but it doesn't have to be perfect. We're using a 7/16 drill bit for a 3/8 hole, so you have some wiggle room.</p>
  <p class="guide">Now that your template is drilled, clamp it to another 21" board and drill through the template hole. Rinse and repeat with <b>6</b> of the 9 21" boards and all 4 of the 9" boards until they all have holes in <b>both</b> ends. It's good practice to try and use the same board as your template for all the other boards since it introduces less error in the process.</p>

    <h3>Start putting it together</h3>
    <p class="guide">Now you're ready for the fun part! To assemble the base, you want to screw a nut onto each threaded rod a few inches, followed by a washer. Then slide the threaded rod through a 21" board and a 9" board like pictured to the right. Add another washer, and then screw on a cap nut to form a foot. Repeat this until you have the base that's pictured to the right. Tighten down all the nuts and square up the base as best you can since you won't be able to change it easily after the next step.</p>

    Base w/o powersupply support

<br>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <p class="guide">Now we're going to attach the support for the power supplies. Set one of the undrilled (hah, don't mind the picture...) 21" sections accross the middle and use nails to secure it in place. Put one in each corner for optimal holding strength. This step is best checked by setting your power supply down and confirming the distance, although we didn't and it still came out fine. To secure the power supplies we used multiple zipties that go all the way around the power supply, however an alternative would be to use the motherboard tray boards as a clamp and tighten it with the nuts. See the picture at the beginning of the page for more detail.</p>

  <div class="col-md-6">
    <p class="guide">To add the motherboard tray, screw a nut down each threaded rod until they're approximately 5 5/8" above the base (this height can always be changed later). This height is determined by your power supply, so test fit it if you have it. Slide down some washers and slide down two 21" boards, followed by four more washers and four more nuts. Before tightening them down, use a level across the support boards and adjust the nuts slightly to get your corners at the same height. Cinch it all up and you're done with the motherboard tray.</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <p class="guide">Adding the graphics card supports are very similar to the motherboard tray, except you want the two sides to be offset. Our bottom support is 4 1/4" above the motherboard tray, while the higher support is 8". This is most easily done with one of your cards and risers for test fitting, rather than using strict measuring. </p>

</div>
<br>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <p class="guide">Finally, to build the top for placement of additional fans or stacking of rigs on top of eachother, you want add your drilled 9" pieces on to the end and bolt them down. You'll need nuts and washers on the lower graphics card support side, but not for the upper since it can just rest against the uppoer support. Lastly, take your last two 21" boards and set them accross the 9" top boards and nail them in. Finish by trimming the threaded rods to length with a hacksaw or sawsall for a cleaner look, or for stacking.</p>
